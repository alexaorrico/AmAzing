# AmAzing: the amazing maze

AmAzing is a prototypical 3D maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world!

AmAzing was written in C++ using the [SDL2 Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org) graphics rendering library and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for fast matrix operations.

Development was performed using Xcode and compiled for macOS 10.13. While other platforms that are supported by SDL2 should be able to run AmAzing, they have not been tested.

### Installation
Currently, the most reliable way to install AmAzing is to import the project into Xcode and compile using the Apple LLVM compiler. AmAzing makes use of C++11 features, which may not be implemented in older compilers (e.g. lambda functions).
